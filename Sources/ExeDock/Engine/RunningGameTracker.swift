/// this greps `ps` for a command line containing the game's own install-dir fragment. Windows
/// processes running under Wine show their full Windows command line in `ps` output - confirmed
/// live earlier this session (ordinary `ps aux` lines like
/// `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\bin\cef\...\steamwebhelper.exe`) - so this is real, not
/// theoretical, but it's still a heuristic: two games sharing an install-dir fragment could
/// collide, and a game launched under an unexpected child-process name won't be seen.

/// once from the dashboard with whatever's currently in `model.steamGames`, so this only polls
/// while there's actually something worth watching (nothing running while Game Mode is locked, or
/// before the library has loaded).
