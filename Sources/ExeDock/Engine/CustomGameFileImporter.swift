/// a random place I should be able to just select it and playdock will move it to the bottle and
/// get it ready," per live feedback. Every game gets its own subfolder
/// (`drive_c/CustomGames/<name>`), so different games' files never collide even though they all
/// share one bottle - `ExeRunner` already sets each launch's working directory to the exe's own
/// folder, so "which game's config/save path is active" already tracks whichever one is actually
/// running, with nothing further needed here for that part.
///
/// This is exactly what makes "for new users" automatic too: the destination bottle
/// (`BottleManager.shared.defaultBottle`) is already created and initialized at first launch by
/// `SetupCoordinator`, with no separate setup step of its own - the `CustomGames` subfolder is just
/// created on demand, the first time anything actually needs it.
