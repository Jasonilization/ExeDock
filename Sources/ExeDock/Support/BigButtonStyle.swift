/// recipe `PlaydockButtonStyle` uses everywhere else - "buttons still not matching to the UI in
/// grids for other formats," per live feedback: the single most-seen button in the whole app
/// (Launch, front and center in the Game Detail view) was still a generic accent-filled rounded
/// rect while every other button had already been ported from the real mockups. Only the sizing is
/// different now, not the visual language.
